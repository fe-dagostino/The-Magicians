# The-Magicians

Last update: July 2022

Who are The Magicians? or better, ***what*** are they? don't worry you are not in the wrong place and this repository in not intended to present you any extraordinary magical effect, in fact in this repository is focused on C/C++ and "The Magicians" is referred to all C/C++ compilers (g++, clang, msvc ...) since many developers think at the compiler has magical power to understand what he wants to do and then to optimize resulting assembly code in the best way. 

I'm sincerely sorry to bring bad news, but the compiler do not have any magic power! We must have a lot of reverence for all software engineers that every day are working on compilers to make them better and to cover new possible optimization, but even if they are extremely clever and capable, they cannot cover the context or the logic of all possible applications, so using the latest compiler with the latest standard do not avoid having bad programs or not well optimized assembly code.

Despite the title of this repository, it is intended as a collection of articles that face with specific topics, moving in depth on each one of them, explaining how it works and presenting objective results. All the topics will be covered avoiding to use specific jargon, instead a simple language will be preferred in order to cover all possible audience even without programming knowledge.

Anyone that would like contributing to "The Magicians" will be more than welcome.
